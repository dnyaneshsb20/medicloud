## 📖 About the Project

The **MediCloud** platform is a web-based healthcare system developed to simplify daily healthcare management for doctors, patients, and pharmacists.

Previously, healthcare management involved manual appointment tracking, paper-based medical records, and handwritten prescriptions, which were slow, error-prone, and difficult to manage.

With this software:
- Patients can book appointments online
- Doctors can view patient records and manage consultations
- E-prescriptions can be generated and accessed digitally
- Pharmacists can manage medicine billing efficiently
- Data is updated in real-time
- Secure authentication ensures role-based access
---

## ✨ Key Features

- Online appointment booking
- Medical record management and history tracking
- E-prescriptions generation and access
- Medicine billing and inventory management
- Real-time updates using Supabase
- Secure authentication and role-based access
